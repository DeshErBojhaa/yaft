### YAFT: Yet Another raFT
This is a copy book implementation of image 2 of the raft paper. https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf

Why?

Because sometimes you need a simple backend for distributed concensus 
that does not rely on any external librarise.
Also, It will be used as a backend for _babyKV_ a simple distributed key value store.
Something like ETCD, but for baby projects.

Is it PROD ready?

Not yet. But will be soon.
